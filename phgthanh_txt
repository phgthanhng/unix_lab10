“It’s Always The End of The World”
 by Nancy Kress

A huge, parched, windswept plain. Nothing moved except dust, blowing ceaselessly. 
Nothing lived except Potter, trudging toward a rickety structure that had once 
been a barn, on what had once been a farm, in what had once been the fertile 
Midwest. He fell—

“John, John, wake up! You’re having a nightmare!”

Linda’s arm shaking him, her face looming over his, the huge curve of her belly 
bumping gently against his chest.

“I…yes…it…” He wrapped his arms around her.

“A nightmare? About your mother?”

“No.” In a little while, he slept again.

The asteroid came closer, closer, until it smashed into Asia, the shock felt 
in quakes even as far away as Iowa. In the time illogic of dreams, immediately 
came the tsunamis, the dust dark as night, the storms and die-offs of 
species after species, the terrible—

This time he woke himself, shaking and sweating. Linda slept on. 
John rose, made himself warm milk, went back to bed.
